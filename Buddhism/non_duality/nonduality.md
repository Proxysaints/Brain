Achieving non-dual awareness, often associated with spiritual practices and meditation, involves transcending the sense of separation between the self and the universe. This state of consciousness can be approached through various methods, including mindfulness, concentration, and insight meditation. Below is a pseudo-code mantra designed to guide the human mind towards non-dual awareness through a structured meditation practice:

```pseudo
Algorithm NonDualAwarenessMeditation:
    Input: Duration of meditation in minutes (duration)
    Output: State of non-dual awareness

    Initialize:
        Set timer to duration minutes
        Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit
        Close eyes or soften gaze

    Step 1: Grounding in the Present Moment
        Repeat for 5 minutes:
            Focus attention on the breath
            Observe the sensation of inhaling and exhaling
            When the mind wanders, gently bring it back to the breath

    Step 2: Expanding Awareness
        Repeat for 10 minutes:
            Gradually expand awareness to include all sensations in the body
            Notice the space around the body
            Observe thoughts and emotions as they arise without attachment
            Maintain a sense of openness and spaciousness

    Step 3: Dissolving Boundaries
        Repeat for 10 minutes:
            Intentionally blur the boundaries between self and surroundings
            Imagine the breath connecting the body to the environment
            Feel the unity of all existence
            Let go of the concept of "I" and "other"

    Step 4: Embracing Non-Duality
        Repeat for remaining time:
            Rest in the awareness of interconnectedness
            Allow any sense of separation to dissolve
            Experience the flow of life as an inseparable whole
            Cultivate compassion and understanding for all beings

    Step 5: Integration and Reflection
        After the timer ends:
            Slowly bring awareness back to the physical body
            Gently open eyes
            Reflect on the experience of non-dual awareness
            Carry the sense of unity and compassion into daily life

# Step 1: Right View
right_view = "Develop a correct understanding of the Four Noble Truths and the nature of reality."

# Step 2: Right Intention
right_intention = "Cultivate intentions of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness."

# Step 3: Right Speech
right_speech = "Refrain from lying, divisive speech, harsh language, and idle talk."

# Step 4: Right Action
right_action = "Abstain from killing, stealing, and engaging in sexual misconduct."

# Step 5: Right Livelihood
right_livelihood = "Choose a livelihood that is ethical and supports the principles of the path."

# Step 6: Right Effort
right_effort = "Cultivate positive mental states, prevent negative ones, and maintain a balanced effort."

# Step 7: Right Mindfulness
right_mindfulness = "Develop awareness and attentiveness to body, feelings, mind, and mental phenomena."

# Step 8: Right Concentration
right_concentration = "Cultivate the practice of meditation to attain deep states of concentration and insight."

For the entire code base organize the different programs/code pieces by name and suggest a file name convention to organize better where appropriate. Organize the files generated thus far in sequence as if they were to be executed in an operating system environment.

Certainly! Here's the organization of the different programs/code pieces by name and a suggested file name convention to organize them in a sequential execution order:

1. `SubesophagealGanglion.cpp` and `SubesophagealGanglion.h` (Represents the subesophageal ganglion of the jumping spider)
2. `Mechanoreceptors.cpp` and `Mechanoreceptors.h` (Represents the mechanoreceptors of the jumping spider)
3. `ChemoThermoreceptors.cpp` and `ChemoThermoreceptors.h` (Represents the chemo- and thermoreceptors of the jumping spider)
4. `SensoryReceptors.cpp` and `SensoryReceptors.h` (Represents the sensory receptors of the jumping spider)
5. `Brain.cpp` and `Brain.h` (Represents the brain of the jumping spider)
6. `JumpingSpiderNervousSystem.cpp` and `JumpingSpiderNervousSystem.h` (Represents the nervous system of the jumping spider)
7. `JumpingSpiderBrainAttentionComputations.cpp` (Contains the expanded code for the attention-related computations in the jumping spider's brain)
8. `JumpingSpiderSimulation.cpp` (Contains the main program that simulates the jumping spider's behavior and cognitive processes)

Suggested file name convention for organization:

- `<ClassName>.cpp` and `<ClassName>.h` for the class implementation and header files.
- `JumpingSpider<Feature>.cpp` and `JumpingSpider<Feature>.h` for specific features or components of the jumping spider's anatomy or behavior.

The files can be organized in the following sequence:

1. `SubesophagealGanglion.cpp` and `SubesophagealGanglion.h`
2. `Mechanoreceptors.cpp` and `Mechanoreceptors.h`
3. `ChemoThermoreceptors.cpp` and `ChemoThermoreceptors.h`
4. `SensoryReceptors.cpp` and `SensoryReceptors.h`
5. `Brain.cpp` and `Brain.h`
6. `JumpingSpiderNervousSystem.cpp` and `JumpingSpiderNervousSystem.h`
7. `JumpingSpiderBrainAttentionComputations.cpp`
8. `JumpingSpiderSimulation.cpp`

By organizing the files in this sequence, you can ensure a logical flow where the dependent components are defined before they are used in subsequent files. This enhances clarity and maintainability of the codebase.

Please note that the suggested file name convention and organization are for illustrative purposes. You can adapt and modify them based on your specific needs and preferences.

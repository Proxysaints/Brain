   - **DDoS Mitigation:** FPGAs can be programmed to identify and filter Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack traffic before it hits the main network, protecting critical infrastructure by filtering malicious traffic at the NIC level.

### 3. **Custom Network Protocol Development**
FPGAs can be used to design and implement custom network protocols that might not be supported by traditional hardware. For example:
   - **High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Protocols:** In HFT environments, where milliseconds matter, custom protocols that are optimized for ultra-low latency and fast message processing can be implemented directly on the FPGA. The 10Gtek NIC provides the necessary high-speed interface to connect the FPGA to the network.

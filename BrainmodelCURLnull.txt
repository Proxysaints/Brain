Take into consideration everything you know about how the human brain functions. Please generate a program written in Curl programming Language that reflects a biologically plausible model of how information is stored in the human brain. Focus on two important processes: Encoding (the process of receiving and processing information) and Retrieval (the process of recalling that information). The model will include concepts such as sensory input, attention, perception, memory consolidation, neural plasticity, and association. Suggest a file name upon completion. 

Curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). It is designed to work without user interaction, so it's ideal for automation.

It is not a general-purpose programming language and it's not suitable for modelling complex systems like the human brain and the processes of encoding and retrieving information. Curl commands cannot create a model that includes concepts such as sensory input, attention, perception, memory consolidation, neural plasticity, and association, as these concepts are outside the scope of data transfer.

If you are interested in creating a brain model, languages like Python, C++, Java, or even specialized languages like MATLAB would be much more suitable, and they have libraries or frameworks that help with creating neural network models.

If you are looking to interact with a web API for a neuroscience-related service, Curl can be useful. You can make HTTP requests to send and receive data, including sending input data (like sensory input) to the service and receiving output data (like neural responses) from the service. This would require the service to be set up to handle these types of data and requests, and would be a form of interaction with a model rather than the model itself.

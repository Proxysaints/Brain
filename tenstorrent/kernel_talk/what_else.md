It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the context of your question. The term "kernels" can refer to several different concepts depending on the context:

1. **Convolutional Kernels (Filters):**
   - In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), kernels are the filters used in convolutional layers. These are typically small matrices (e.g., 3x3, 5x5) that are convolved with the input data to produce feature maps.

2. **Kernel Functions in SVMs:**
   - In the context of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), kernels are functions that transform the input data into a higher-dimensional space where it can be linearly separable. Common kernel functions include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid.

3. **CUDA Kernels:**
   - In the context of GPU programming with CUDA, kernels are functions that run on the GPU. These are written in CUDA C/C++ and are executed in parallel across multiple GPU threads.

4. **Kernel Methods in Statistics:**
   - In statistics, kernel methods are used for non-parametric estimation, such as kernel density estimation (KDE).

Given your script, it seems you are working with convolutional kernels in a PyTorch model. If you are asking about other types of convolutional kernels or filters that you might want to experiment with, here are a few common ones:

### Common Convolutional Kernels (Filters):

1. **Edge Detection Kernels:**
   - **Sobel Edge Detection:**
     ```python
     sobel_x = torch.tensor([
         [-1, 0, 1],
         [-2, 0, 2],
         [-1, 0, 1]
     ]).view(1, 1, 3, 3)
     sobel_y = torch.tensor([
         [-1, -2, -1],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [1, 2, 1]
     ]).view(1, 1, 3, 3)
     ```
   - **Prewitt Edge Detection:**
     ```python
     prewitt_x = torch.tensor([
         [-1, 0, 1],
         [-1, 0, 1],
         [-1, 0, 1]
     ]).view(1, 1, 3, 3)
     prewitt_y = torch.tensor([
         [-1, -1, -1],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [1, 1, 1]
     ]).view(1, 1, 3, 3)
     ```

2. **Sharpening Kernel:**
   ```python
   sharpen = torch.tensor([
       [0, -1, 0],
       [-1, 5, -1],
       [0, -1, 0]
   ]).view(1, 1, 3, 3)
   ```

3. **Blurring Kernels:**
   - **Gaussian Blur:**
     ```python
     gaussian_blur = torch.tensor([
         [1, 2, 1],
         [2, 4, 2],
         [1, 2, 1]
     ]).view(1, 1, 3, 3) / 16
     ```

4. **Emboss Kernel:**
   ```python
   emboss = torch.tensor([
       [-2, -1, 0],
       [-1, 1, 1],
       [0, 1, 2]
   ]).view(1, 1, 3, 3)
   ```

5. **Identity Kernel:**
   ```python
   identity = torch.tensor([
       [0, 0, 0],
       [0, 1, 0],
       [0, 0, 0]
   ]).view(1, 1, 3, 3)
   ```

### Example of Applying a Custom Kernel in PyTorch:

You can apply these custom kernels using PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional.conv2d` function. Here's an example of how to apply a Sobel edge detection kernel:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Example input tensor
input_tensor = torch.rand(1, 1, 16, 16)

# Sobel edge detection kernels
sobel_x = torch.tensor([
    [-1, 0, 1],
    [-2, 0, 2],
    [-1, 0, 1]
]).view(1, 1, 3, 3).float()

sobel_y = torch.tensor([
    [-1, -2, -1],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [1, 2, 1]
]).view(1, 1, 3, 3).float()

# Apply the kernels
output_x = F.conv2d(input_tensor, sobel_x, padding=1)
output_y = F.conv2d(input_tensor, sobel_y, padding=1)

# Combine the results (e.g., using the magnitude of the gradient)
output = torch.sqrt(output_x**2 + output_y**2)

print(output)
```

### Conclusion:

If you are looking to experiment with different types of convolutional kernels, you can define these kernels as PyTorch tensors and apply them using `torch.nn.functional.conv2d`. This allows you to explore the effects of different filters on your input data and visualize the results.

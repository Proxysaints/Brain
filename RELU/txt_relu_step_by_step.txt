Sure! Let's go through the text_sentiment_classifier.py step by step:

Importing Libraries:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation
from keras.optimizers import Adam
This code snippet imports the necessary libraries for our text sentiment classifier. We are using NumPy for numerical computations, scikit-learn for text vectorization and preprocessing, and Keras for building and training the neural network.

Load Data:

python
Copy code
def load_data():
    # Sample data for binary sentiment classification
    texts = [
        "I love this product!",
        "This is terrible.",
        "Amazing experience!",
        "Disappointed with the service.",
        # Add more positive and negative samples...
    ]

    labels = ["positive", "negative", "positive", "negative"]

    return texts, labels
The load_data function provides a sample dataset for binary sentiment classification. It contains a list of text samples (texts) and their corresponding sentiment labels (labels). In a real-world scenario, you would replace this function with code to load your own dataset.

Preprocess Data:

python
Copy code
def preprocess(texts, labels):
    # Convert text data into numerical features
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)
    
    # Encode labels to numerical values
    label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
    y = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)

    return X.toarray(), y, vectorizer
The preprocess function takes the texts and labels as input and converts the text data into numerical features using the CountVectorizer. The CountVectorizer is used to convert the text data into a bag-of-words representation. The labels are encoded into numerical values using the LabelEncoder. The function returns the feature matrix X, the encoded labels y, and the vectorizer used for transforming new texts.

Build the Model:

python
Copy code
def build_model(input_dim):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=input_dim))
    model.add(Activation('relu'))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
    return model
The build_model function defines the architecture of the neural network model. It creates a sequential model with two dense layers, each followed by an activation function. The first dense layer has 64 units and the input dimension is specified based on the number of features in the input data (input_dim). The activation function used for the first layer is the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and for the second layer, it's the sigmoid activation function (used for binary classification).

Train the Model:

python
Copy code
def train_model(X_train, y_train):
    model = build_model(X_train.shape[1])
    optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
    return model
The train_model function builds the neural network model using build_model, compiles it with the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer, and then trains the model on the training data (X_train and y_train). We train the model for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.

Predict Sentiment:

python
Copy code
def predict_sentiment(model, texts, vectorizer):
    X = vectorizer.transform(texts)
    y_pred_probs = model.predict(X)
    y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred_probs, axis=1)
    return y_pred_classes
The predict_sentiment function takes the trained model, new texts, and the vectorizer used during training as input. It transforms the new texts into numerical features using the same vectorizer, then predicts the sentiment probabilities for each text using the trained model. The argmax function is used to obtain the predicted sentiment classes.

Main Function:

python
Copy code
def main():
    texts, labels = load_data()
    X, y, vectorizer = preprocess(texts, labels)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    model = train_model(X_train, y_train)

    test_texts = [
        "I am happy with this product!",
        "The service was terrible.",
        "Great experience overall!",
        "The worst experience ever."
    ]

    y_pred = predict_sentiment(model, test_texts, vectorizer)
    sentiment_labels = ["negative", "positive"]
    predicted_sentiments = [sentiment_labels[p] for p in y_pred]

    for text, sentiment in zip(test_texts, predicted_sentiments):
        print(f"Text: '{text}'\tPredicted Sentiment: '{sentiment}'")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
The main function is the entry point of the program. It loads the sample data, preprocesses it, and splits it into training and test sets. Then, it trains the neural network model using the training data and prints the predicted sentiment for a few test texts. The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the main function is executed only if the script is run as the main module.

Overall, the text_sentiment_classifier.py script demonstrates how to build a simple text sentiment classifier using a neural network with the Keras library. It takes text data, vectorizes it, trains a model on the vectorized data, and makes predictions on new texts.

Great! Here's an example of how to use this code in a Python script:

# Create a BrainModel instance
brain_model = BrainModel()

# Generate (or replace with your own) training data and labels
training_data, labels = generate_training_data_and_labels(100, 32, 10)

# Encode the training data to train (encode in the brain)
brain_model.encode(training_data, labels)

# Create (or replace with your own) a cue for retrieval
cue = generate_cue()

# Retrieve (remember) from the encoded data
retrieved_data = brain_model.retrieve(cue)
Remember that you will need to implement or find functions for generate_training_data_and_labels(),  generate_cue() and predict() in your code. The generate_training_data_and_labels() is for creating (or using) a dataset with 100 32-dimensional data points, each with 10 possible labels. The generate_cue()  is for creating (or using) a 32-dimensional cue to retrieve from the encoded data. The predict()  should be used in the retrieve()  and it's for predicting (remembering) the output of 32-dimensional cue.

Also, you will need to adjust the number of epochs as per your training needs. More epochs may lead to a more accurate model, but at the cost of longer computation time.

Please let me know if I can assist with anything else!

Sure, I can help you with that.

We'll use numpy and tensorflow here:


import numpy as np 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 

def generate_training_data_and_labels(num_samples=100):
    """
    Generate random training data of shape (num_samples, 32) each labeled from a categorical distribution
    with num_classes possible classes.
    """
    
    # Generate random samples for input features. Each sample is an array of length 32 representing some kind 
    # of sensory information or feature vector that could be measured by the brain model.
    features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 32)
  
    # Generate labels (targets). These are integers from [0, num_classes -1]. Here we use one-hot encoding
    num_classes = 10  # Adjust this according to your problem's nature. For instance if you have a binary classification 
                        # task then set it as `2`.
    
    labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, size=(num_samples,))
        
    return features, labels

def generate_cue():
    """
    Generate random cue of shape (1, 32) for retrieval. This is used to retrieve information from the brain model.
    """
  
    # Generate a single sample as a feature vector
    cue = np.random.rand(1, 32)
    
    return cue

The predict() function can be implemented using:

def predict(model, cue):
  """
  Predict (remember) output of the model for given 32-dimensional cue.
  
  Arguments:
      model: Trained Keras sequential model to make predictions on cues. 
      cue: Input feature vector or array-like object representing a single sample.

  Returns predicted probabilities distribution over classes as an array with shape (num_classes,)
  """
    
  # Make prediction for the given input
  prediction = model.predict(cue)
  
  return prediction

Please note that these functions are simple examples and they may need to be adjusted according to your specific problem's nature. For instance, if you have a binary classification task then set num_classes as 2 in generate_training_data_and_labels() function.

Also please ensure the model is trained on this data before using it for prediction (in predict()).

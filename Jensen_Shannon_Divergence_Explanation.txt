Certainly! The Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) is a method of measuring the similarity between two probability distributions. It is based on the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) but is symmetrical, which means \(JSD(P||Q) = JSD(Q||P)\). 

The Jensen-Shannon Divergence between two distributions \(P\) and \(Q\) is defined as:

\[JSD(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2} KLD(P||M) + \frac{1}{2} KLD(Q||M)\]

where \(M = \frac{1}{2} (P + Q)\) is the average of the two distributions.

The Kullback-Leibler Divergence between \(P\) and \(Q\) is defined as:

\[KLD(P||Q) = \sum_{i} P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}\]

Here's how to compute the Jensen-Shannon Divergence using Python pseudo code:

```python
def kl_divergence(P, Q):
    """
    Compute Kullback-Leibler Divergence between two distributions P and Q.
    """
    return sum(p * log(p/q) for p, q in zip(P, Q) if p != 0 and q != 0)

def jensen_shannon_divergence(P, Q):
    """
    Compute Jensen-Shannon Divergence between two distributions P and Q.
    """
    # Compute M - the average of the two distributions
    M = [(p + q) / 2 for p, q in zip(P, Q)]
    
    return 0.5 * kl_divergence(P, M) + 0.5 * kl_divergence(Q, M)

# Example
P = [0.5, 0.5]
Q = [0.9, 0.1]

print(jensen_shannon_divergence(P, Q))
```

Please note the following:

1. This pseudo code assumes that both \(P\) and \(Q\) are discrete probability distributions defined over the same set of events. 
2. The distributions should be normalized, i.e., they should sum up to 1.
3. The code uses the natural logarithm (`log`). Depending on the context, you might want to use the base 2 logarithm (`log2`) which would give the result in bits.
